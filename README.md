# GB - Simple GameBoy Emulator

## Building on Windows with Visual Studio

Call `shell.bat` to setup the development environment (you might have to open it and adjust the path to `vcvarsall.bat` on your system), then execute `build.bat`.

Call `devenv gb.exe` to debug, or simply use the VSCode project (make sure `shell.bat` has been called and then open VSCode with `code .`).
